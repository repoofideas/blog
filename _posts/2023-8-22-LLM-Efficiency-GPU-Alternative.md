# LLM Research at a Hardware Company: Striving for Efficiency and Developing GPU Alternatives

In the burgeoning field of AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the forefront of innovation. Hardware companies are uniquely positioned to address the dual challenges of enhancing efficiency in LLMs and pioneering alternatives to traditional GPU-based computing. These endeavors are not merely technological pursuits; they are vital to democratizing AI and fostering cross-industry innovation. This post delves into the recent advancements and open problems in these areas, with a focus on hardware companies' role in shaping the future of LLM research.

## Making LLMs Efficient

The launch of GPT-3.5 in November 2022 ignited concerns about latency and cost in production. However, rapid advancements led to the development of models that rivaled GPT-3.5's performance but required only 2% of its memory footprint.

Models such as Alpaca 7B and Guanaco 7B have demonstrated significant reductions in memory requirements, with Guanaco 7B utilizing 4-bit quantization to achieve a mere 6GB memory footprint.

The evaluation of these models against GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 has been complex, reflecting the inherent challenges in LLM performance assessment.

Innovative model compression techniques have played a key role in these advancements:

* Knowledge Distillation: Training smaller models to emulate larger ones.
* Quantization: Utilizing fewer bits to represent parameters, reducing model size.
* Low-Rank Factorization: Replacing high-dimensional tensors with lower-dimensional ones to minimize parameters.
* Pruning: Eliminating unnecessary components of the model.
These techniques continue to be relevant, with Alpaca employing knowledge distillation, and QLoRA utilizing low-rank factorization and quantization.
