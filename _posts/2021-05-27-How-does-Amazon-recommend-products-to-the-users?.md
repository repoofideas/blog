### Intro

Before you buy a product, a typical decision process may include comparison of similar products, browsing multiple brands, or consulting an expert(if you are lucky enough to know one ðŸ¤”).

Since Amazon is the largest online retailer in the world, I became interested in how their website map personalized recommendations between staggering number of products and users. Upon research, I've found an insightful paper[^1] and patent[^2] from Rahul Bhagat, an applied scientist at Amazon. The introduction of the paper states that used **repeat purchase history** and **product type** for personalized recommendations.

For a customer <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_{j} = -1" style = 'vertical-align:middle'> and a product <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A_{i} = -1" style = 'vertical-align:middle'> that has been bought repeatedly for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k"  style = 'vertical-align:middle'> times, the following is the first assumption for the modeling.

For the following assumptions we are
