# Introducing My Book Reader

Due to COVID-19, all of my courses for fall semester turned remote. Due to extreme circumstances, I have decided to temporarily move with my family. At home, my mother is suffering from xerophthalmia, which makes her difficult to see bright lights or screens. Watching her struggle made me research how many people
are suffering from vision impairment: according to estimates from WHO, a staggering 2.2 billion have some type of vision impairment and this number is quickly increasing. Now, if you are accustomed to digital format, it is not difficult to have texts read to you. However, if you are like my mother, who collects quite a few books and mostly reads printed books, then vision-impairment is truly devastating. I have tested various text-reading applications in the market, and I have identified common issues:
1. There is no audio text-reading capabilities
2. If there is audio text-reading, the reading speed cannot be controlled or you have to rely on other volunteers to help you
3. UI is not friendly for people with impaired vision

That is where I got inspiration to work on My Book Reader, a mobile app that can read printed text. Please provide feedbacks or PR in [my-book-reader](https://github.com/repoofideas/my-book-reader) if you are interested! Many thanks to [KJ Huang](https://github.com/jackysiumkj) for collaborating on this project.
