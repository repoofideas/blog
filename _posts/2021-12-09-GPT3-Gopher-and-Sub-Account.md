title: GPT3, Gopher, and 부캐(Sub Account)

There's been a bit of a hiatus since my last post, but the recent paper from Deepmind motivated me to write up a quick post.

You can check the [Deepmind Blog Post](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/language-modelling-at-scale) to see the original graph.

Looking at the rate of innovation from GPT-3 to Gopher against human benchmark, it seems like a huge portion of white collar labor performed by human will be reduced by pretrained 
models within the next decade. We are likely going to see huge socioeconomic changes and I believe vast majority of people are not ready for such drastic transformation. 
Personally, I started as an accounting major entering college and it took me 3 years to transition into machine learning engineering career.
This was with very supportive parents and great mentors helping the transition. I would be naive to think that most people would have that kind of opportunity. 
Even with this kind of transition I can't guarantee I would be employable in the next few decades if current trend continues. Nobody should feel safe.

This may sound a bit off tangent but there's a concept called '부캐(sub-character)' in Korean which originated in gaming community. 
It's a term when players make a second account to play more casually than the main account. Now that term has evolved to refer to 
people who develop their hobby extensively to share it on social media for engagement and potentially create second income. 
This sounds like a valid strategy worth considering especially since most people garner much of their self-identity and income from our occupation. 
I have personally been exploring few hobbies that does not involve staring at monitor(which I do more than enough for my main job) like music production & jazz piano. 
I am at no level to create any income currently but I hope to share my progress in the near future. If you are reading this, I encourage you to actively explore in
creating a 부캐(pronounced as boo-keh).
