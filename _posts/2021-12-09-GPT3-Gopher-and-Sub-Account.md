title: GPT3, Gopher, and 부캐(Sub Account)

There's been a bit of a hiatus since my last post, but the recent paper from Deepmind motivated me to write up a quick post.

You can check the [Deepmind Blog Post](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/language-modelling-at-scale) to see the original graph.

Looking at the rate of innovation from GPT-3 to Gopher against the human benchmark, it seems like a huge portion of white-collar labor performed by humans will be reduced by pretrained models within the next decade. We are likely going to see huge socioeconomic changes and I believe the vast majority of people are not ready for such drastic transformation. 
Personally, it took me 3 years to transition into a machine learning engineering career after my military service.
This was with very supportive parents and great mentors helping the transition. It would be naive to think that most people would have that kind of opportunity
so how will people adapt to the shortage of demand for human labor? Even I can't guarantee I would be employable in the next few decades if the current trend continues.
This is when I realized I was tying much of my self-worth and identity to my occupation.

This may sound a bit off tangent but there's a phrase called '부캐(sub-character)' in Korean which originated in the gaming community.
It's a term when players make a second account to play more casually than their main account. Now that term has evolved to refer to 
people who develop their hobby or gimmick extensively to share it on social media for engagement and potentially create a second income. 
This sounds like a valid strategy worth considering especially since most people garner much of their self-identity and income from our occupation. 
I have personally been exploring a few hobbies that do not involve staring at a monitor(which I do more than enough for my main job) like music production & jazz piano. 
I am at no level to create any income currently but I hope to share my progress shortly. If you are reading this, I encourage you to actively explore in
creating a 부캐(pronounced as boo-keh).
