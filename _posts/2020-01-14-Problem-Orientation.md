# Problem Orientation for the Long Term

It has been a year since I have enrolled in a computer science graduate program. A lot has changed since then, including my rent price(rip my savings), but there's one thing I am repeating exactly the same as last year at this period. I am applying to summer internships amid turndowns. Let's look at a post from the subreddit r/cscareeradvice that describes how internship rejection truly feels.

>What you feel, anytime you begin to think about them; That hurt you can’t exactly articulate into words? It’s okay to feel those feelings. It’s okay to hurt. If necessary, it’s okay to cry. You won’t be any less of a person because you’re experiencing strong emotions.

That was actually from r/datingadvice but you can see the analogy! Gratefully, I was able to land a full-time research internship last summer but there was one important lesson which I would like to instill in myself for an optimal, long-term research career. Last year, I was embarrassingly overconfident in few deep learning techniques that I have learned. I have recommended coworkers to apply those techniques without valid justification or understanding of their research problems. As amazing as deep learning is, prioritizing technique itself is short-sighted and easily misguided.

Early this year, I found a book written by Peter Feibelman called *'
A PhD is Not Enough,'* an alarming title for a mere master's student. I want to quote a great excerpt about problem-orientation.

>When a remarkable new instrument, such as the laser, or a technique, like nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, becomes available, it is often profitable to ask how its capabilities can be applied to solving outstanding problems. Few scientists, however, are
able to make a long-term success of applying their favorite technique to one problem after another. Eventually the well runs dry. It is the researchers who focus on a significant problem and are willing to bring to it whatever resources are necessary who give the most
absorbing talks, write the most significant papers, and win grant support most easily. I strongly recommend that you try to teach yourself to be **problem-oriented**, to plan your research projects so that they address important scientific issues regardless of what techniques you and your coworkers will need to use.

Looking at the number of papers coming out of deep learning community these days, learning the new SOTA technique will not be marketable for much. Without problem-orientation, it may be nearly impossible to survive in this rapidly evolving field and one must steer away from the juicy trap of technique-orientation.
