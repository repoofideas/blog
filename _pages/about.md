# Who am I? 

I have recently graduated with a master's degree in computer science from Stony Brook University and currently looking for full-tiem opportunities. My research at [LUNR lab](https://lunr.cs.stonybrook.edu/) is focused in developing deep-learning based aggregation mechanisms that can prevent inference from combining semantically incompatible evidence. I am also interested in empirical side of designing large scale experiments and evaluating performances of language models.  This research project is advised by [Prof. Niranjan Balasubramanian](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~niranjan/) and funded by NSF. I have previously worked in projects in domains of computer vision and neuroscience.

I also love to test with multi-modal and user-guided generation. The logo and title font in my front page is generated by AI, and I have modified about 2%(~1200 pixels) of it manually.
