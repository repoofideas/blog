I have recently graduated with a master's degree in computer science from Stony Brook University. My research at [LUNR lab](https://lunr.cs.stonybrook.edu/) was focused on developing deep-learning-based aggregation mechanisms that can prevent inference from combining semantically incompatible evidence. I am also interested in the empirical side of designing large-scale experiments and evaluating the performances of language models.  This research project was advised by [Prof. Niranjan Balasubramanian](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~niranjan/) and funded by NSF. I have previously worked on projects in the domains of computer vision and neuroscience.

I also love to test with multi-modal and user-guided generation. The logo and the title font on my front page are generated by AI, and I have modified about 2%(~1200 pixels) of it manually.
